# Contact Forecast PHASE 2: the first held-out evaluation, on 2026. Verifies the
# R1/ridge/HGB freeze chain and refuses to proceed on any drift, records and
# hashes the Phase 2 authorization, pins ONE immutable 2026 prospective snapshot
# and verifies its integrity hashes, then evaluates the already-frozen Model D
# ridge against the frozen benchmarks. Fits nothing on 2026, tunes nothing,
# deploys nothing, and never reads 2025. Writes to outputs/forecast_phase2/.

# frozen H=100 Contact Forecast measured over a longer window; the two results
# are never pooled and the H=100 Phase 2 result is never modified. The
# evaluation re-derives the sealed fit and refuses to proceed unless it
# reproduces the frozen coefficients exactly. Fits nothing on 2026, tunes
# nothing, deploys nothing, never reads 2025. Writes to

# Version 0.14: THE ONE-TIME HELD-OUT 2025 PITCHER CONTACT LUCK REPLICATION.
#
# This target OPENS 2025. It may be run exactly once: it writes an immutable
# execution-start receipt before the first byte of held-out data is read, and
# every later invocation refuses. Requires internet access (Baseball Savant and
# the MLB Stats API) for the full 2025 regular season, which is a large, slow
# download -- say so before running it.
#
# Preconditions, all enforced by the runner and none skippable: the Version 0.14
# freeze validates, the maintainer authorization binds to that exact freeze, the
# pre-execution manifest is sealed and matches the current runner, the working
# tree is clean, 2025 protection is intact, and the replication namespace is
# empty. Do not run this without the maintainer asking for it in that moment.
